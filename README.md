# Structured TodoMVC in Elm

This repository have examples of different styles in scaling an Elm App. The [official TodoMVC Elm example](https://github.com/evancz/elm-todomvc), a single file app, was used to show how to structure your app in different modules and files, allowing it to scale.

Check out the different refactors:

- [NoMap approach with Domain focus](https://github.com/rogeriochaves/structured-elm-todomvc/tree/nomap-domain)
- [NoMap approach with Technical focus](https://github.com/rogeriochaves/structured-elm-todomvc/tree/nomap-technical)
- [OutMsg approach](https://github.com/rogeriochaves/structured-elm-todomvc/tree/outmsg)
- [Translator approach](https://github.com/rogeriochaves/structured-elm-todomvc/tree/translator)

Alos, be sure to read [the blogpost](https://medium.com/@_rchaves_/structured-todomvc-example-with-elm-a68d87cd38da) explaining how to start a refactor like this.
